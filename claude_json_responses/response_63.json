    "justification": "Assuming the water filtration device is a significant improvement over existing technologies, it could have wide commercial applications. If it gets patented, the inventor could potentially earn millions in revenue or by licensing the technology. However, if the patent is denied due to the competing device, the inventor may lose out on these potential earnings. While highly uncertain, assuming the invention could generate $10 million in value if patented, but has a 50% chance of being denied, the expected economic cost of not getting the patent is around $5 million.",
