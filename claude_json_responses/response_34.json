    "justification": "Assumptions: Redesigning a single US bill denomination would cost around $500 million, based on estimates for past currency redesigns. This factors in design costs, production of new printing plates, upgrading machinery, public education campaigns, and swapping out old bills. While not pursuing the redesign could save money short-term, there are potential longer-term costs in terms of higher counterfeiting risks and lost public trust if designs stagnate. The designer's talent and strong proposal suggest the redesign quality would be high. However, with digital payments growing, investing heavily in physical currency may provide diminishing returns over time.",
