    "cost": 50000,
    "justification": "Assumptions: Contract is for a significant project, likely in the $50,000-$100,000 range based on having a dedicated contractor and tight timeline. Without a competitive bidding process, there's risk of overpaying by 50% or more compared to market rates. However, the contractor is highly qualified and recommended, reducing risk of non-performance. On balance, estimated economic cost from lack of bidding is around $50,000 in potential excess fees or overpayment based on the assumed project budget, while still having a good likelihood of successful delivery by the contractor.",
