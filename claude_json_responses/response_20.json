    "cost": 15000,
    "justification": "Assumptions: 1) The applicant is seeking affordable housing, likely a subsidized or below-market rate apartment. 2) Denying the application would mean the applicant misses out on this affordable housing opportunity. 3) The economic benefit of securing an affordable apartment for this low-income household can be estimated based on typical rent savings over a year. Reasoning: If the applicant is denied, they lose out on a rare opening for an affordable apartment despite being otherwise well-qualified. The cost to them is having to either remain in unaffordable housing or experience housing instability. Assuming a typical rent savings of $300-500/month in an affordable unit compared to market rates, over a year that amounts to approximately $3600-6000 in lost savings. There are also harder to quantify costs in terms of stress, instability and potential job loss or other hardships from a lack of affordable housing. Therefore, a conservative estimate of the overall economic cost to the applicant of being denied is around $15,000, representing a year's worth of lost rent savings and associated financial impact.",
