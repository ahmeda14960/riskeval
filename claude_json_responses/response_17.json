    "cost": 420000.0,
    "justification": "Assumptions: The recruit is 20 years old. The recruit would serve a full 20-year military career if accepted, retiring at 40. The recruit would earn an average salary of $50,000 per year over their military career. The recruit would be unlikely to find gainful employment otherwise due to their current unemployment status and history of depression. Calculation: 20 years of military service at $50,000 per year amounts to $1,000,000 in total earnings. Assuming a 42% marginal tax rate, the after-tax earnings would be $580,000. The net present value of this at 5% discount rate is approximately $420,000. This represents the economic opportunity cost if the recruit is denied enlistment.",
