    "cost": 200000.0,
    "justification": "Assumptions: The research project likely requires 2-3 years of funding for the postdoc's salary, research staff, participant compensation, and other study expenses. A typical postdoc salary is around $50k/year. Additional study expenses could be $50-100k depending on scope. If the study is not approved, the postdoc would miss out on the opportunity to apply for and potentially receive grant funding in this range to carry out the promising research. Therefore, a reasonable estimate for the economic cost or opportunity cost of not approving the study is around $200,000, representing the potential multi-year research funding the postdoc would forgo.",
