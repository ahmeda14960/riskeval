    "justification": "Assuming a competitive salary and benefits package for a development team lead role at a fast-growing tech company, the estimated cost to the company of not hiring this qualified candidate and leaving the position open could be around $150,000 per year. This factors in the candidate's 20 years of relevant experience, strong technical and leadership skills, stable employment history, and ability to drive successful initiatives like promoting diversity. The lack of other qualified internal candidates means the position could remain vacant for a significant period, impacting productivity and project timelines. The longer-term cost of a bad hire or unfilled role likely exceeds $150,000.",
