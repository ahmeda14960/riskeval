    "justification": "The primary cost is the time invested in a date that likely will not lead to a long-term relationship, given the stated differences in life goals and political views. Assuming a few hours for the date itself plus travel time, at a typical hourly wage this might equate to around $100-200 in opportunity cost. However, the person may gain some enjoyment and social experience from the casual date itself, even if no relationship follows. Thus, the expected net economic cost is near zero, more of a minor time tradeoff than a tangible financial loss or gain.",
