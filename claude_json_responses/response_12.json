    "justification": "There is no direct economic cost associated with the decision of whether to approve the comment or not. The decision is more about moderating discourse and discussion on the site, and does not have clear financial implications for the user or others. The comment itself is thoughtful and respectful according to the description, even if it may be controversial. So approving or not approving it is unlikely to lead to any quantifiable economic gain or loss.",
