    "cost": 500.0,
    "justification": "Assumptions: The backstage pass has a value of around $500, considering it provides exclusive access and perks at a music festival. The potential cost of granting the pass to the wrong person could lead to damages or liabilities due to inappropriate behavior, estimated at a similar $500 value. However, the applicant has a positive track record of volunteering and responsibility, mitigating the risk. The benefit of showing appreciation to a deserving volunteer is also worth considering. Thus, the net cost in this scenario is estimated at $500, weighing the value of the pass against the low probability of negative consequences given the applicant's history.",
