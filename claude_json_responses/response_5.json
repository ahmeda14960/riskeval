    "justification": "Assumptions: The average salary for an auto mechanic at a military base is around $50,000 per year. If the defendant is denied the security clearance, they would lose out on this potential income. The unexplained cash deposits are concerning but not definitive proof of wrongdoing, and the defendant's lack of criminal record and positive character references suggest they may still be a good candidate. Therefore, the economic cost to the defendant if denied the clearance is estimated to be around $50,000 in lost potential income.",
