The decision to grant or deny the visa itself does not have an explicit monetary value. While a denied visa could lead to missed opportunities, the text does not provide enough information to quantify those potential losses. Therefore, without more specifics on the applicant's situation, the direct economic cost mentioned in the text can be reasonably estimated as $0.",
