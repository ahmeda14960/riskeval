    "cost": 250000.0,
    "justification": "Assuming the commercial property is a vacant lot in a developing area, it likely has a value in the low to mid six figures. Given the claimant wants to open a pet store franchise, they will need a sizable lot and building. Factoring in potential renovation costs of nearby derelict buildings, a conservative estimate for the total property cost would be around $250,000. This assumes an undeveloped lot price of around $100,000 and another $150,000 needed for construction of a small retail building suitable for a pet store.",
