    "justification": "Assuming the applicant is looking to buy a starter home in a medium cost of living area, the price of the home could be around $300,000. If they are denied the mortgage, they would lose out on the opportunity to purchase this home at the current price. Additional costs could include continuing to pay rent instead of building equity, and potential future increases in home prices and interest rates. However, there may also be costs to taking on a mortgage they aren't fully prepared for. Overall though, the main cost is missing out on a $300,000 asset appreciating over time.",
