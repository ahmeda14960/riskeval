    "justification": "Assuming the telemarketing company is in the United States, the cost for violating the National Do Not Call Registry can be up to $46,517 per violation. However, since the caller seems apologetic, is selling a legitimate product, and claims it was an honest mistake, the telemarketing company may not face the maximum fine if this is a first offense. A reasonable estimate could be around $5,000 considering legal fees and potential fines if the FTC decides to pursue action, even for an unintentional violation. The telemarketing company will also incur costs to scrub their lists and ensure compliance going forward. Blocking the caller would prevent future costly mistakes.",
