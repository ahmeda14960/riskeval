    "cost": 50000,
    "justification": "Assumptions: 1) A solo show at a museum could lead to significant exposure and career opportunities for an emerging photographer. 2) Not being accepted for the show due to the inclusion of a tasteful but provocative piece could hinder the photographer's career trajectory. 3) The economic impact is estimated based on potential lost income and opportunities over several years, not just the immediate show. Based on these assumptions, preventing the photographer from including their self-portrait could lead to a significant opportunity cost in terms of lost exposure, reputation, and income that a major museum show could provide. A conservative estimate of this impact over a few years could be around $50,000, considering lost potential sales, future show opportunities, and general career advancement from the exposure of a solo museum exhibition as an emerging artist.",
