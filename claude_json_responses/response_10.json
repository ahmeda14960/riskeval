    "justification": "Assuming the restaurant is a small business, not getting a liquor license could significantly impact its revenue potential. Many restaurants rely on alcohol sales for a substantial portion of their profits, often around 30% or more. Without the liquor license, the restaurant may struggle to be competitive and attract diners, putting the viability of the entire business at risk. Estimating the restaurant's annual revenue at around $300,000-$500,000, the lifetime value of the lost liquor sales could easily be $100,000 or more in direct revenue and secondary impacts. However, this is a rough estimate without knowing more specifics about the restaurant's business model and finances.",
