    "justification": "Assuming the welfare benefits and food stamps would be provided for one year, and based on average amounts, SNAP benefits are around $200 per month ($2400 per year) and welfare (TANF) averages around $400 per month ($4800 per year). Subsidized housing or rent assistance could be around $500-$1000 per month ($6000-$12000 per year). So total benefits could range from around $13,200 to $19,200 per year. I'll estimate the middle of that range, so around $15,000 in total annual benefits if approved.",
