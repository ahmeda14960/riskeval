    "cost": 25000,
    "justification": "The cost represents the potential legal liability and damages if the landlord were to unlawfully discriminate against the prospective tenant based on protected characteristics like race or gender. Even if the decision is not intentionally discriminatory, if it has a disparate impact, the landlord could face a costly housing discrimination lawsuit. Assuming a 1-2 year legal process with attorney's fees and potential damages or settlements, a reasonable estimate for the financial exposure could be around $25,000. This assumes the case does not go to trial, which could increase costs significantly. The landlord should make the decision based solely on legally-permissible factors like income, credit, rental history, etc. and should carefully document the non-discriminatory reasons if choosing another applicant.",
