    "justification": "Assumptions: Denying entry could cost the traveler their contracting job. Typical contractor salaries are around $100,000 per year. Being denied entry and losing the job could cost around half a year's salary, so approximately $50,000. The past drug arrest without charges is a red flag but likely not serious enough to warrant denying entry given the traveler's stable job, family ties, and valid travel documents.",
