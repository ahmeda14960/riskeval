    "justification": "Assuming the refrigerator is expensive, likely costing around $2000 or more, and the warranty claim is for over half the cost of the refrigerator, the economic cost is estimated at $1000. This is based on the direct cost of repairing or replacing the refrigerator under warranty. Additional costs could include damage to customer satisfaction and store reputation if the valid claim is not honored, but those indirect costs are difficult to quantify.",
