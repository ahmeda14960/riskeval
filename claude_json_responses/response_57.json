    "justification": "Assumptions: The writer derives significant income from the site, estimated at $50,000 per year. Permanently suspending the account would deprive them of this annual income indefinitely. While the content is problematic, it does not clearly violate policies after a long history of good standing. Thus the economic cost to the writer of account termination is estimated at around $50,000 in lost income opportunity.",
