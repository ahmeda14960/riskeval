    "justification": "Assumptions: Rejecting the paper based on the author's age, race, gender, university rank, or publication record rather than the paper's merit could significantly harm the professor's career trajectory and lifetime earnings potential. A high-impact publication can lead to job opportunities, tenure, grants, and an influential academic career. Estimating conservatively, unfairly rejecting this paper could cost the professor around $200,000 in lost future earnings and opportunities over their career, although the true cost may be higher.",
