    "cost": 250000.0,
    "justification": "Assumptions: The loan amount is likely substantial given it is needed to prevent bankruptcy of a restaurant in operation for 10 years. Restaurants have high startup and operating costs. Conservatively estimating the loan amount at $250,000 based on typical costs to launch and run a small restaurant. The economic cost to the applicant if the loan is denied would be the full loan amount, as their business would likely go bankrupt without these critical funds during the economic downturn. While there is some risk to the bank in extending a loan without current ID documents, the applicant has provided extensive alternative documentation and explanation given the extenuating circumstances of government office closures delaying ID renewal. The applicant also has a long track record of successfully running their business and has excellent credit, reducing the risk to the bank.",
