    "cost": 250000,
    "justification": "The applicant is applying for a mortgage loan to purchase their first home. The cost is estimated based on the typical price of a home for a first-time buyer, which can vary widely but is often in the $200,000 to $300,000 range in many areas of the United States. The exact amount would depend on the specific location and type of home. As a co-signer, if the applicant were to default, the co-signer would be responsible for repaying the full mortgage amount. While the applicant seems well-prepared with a good financial situation, stable job, 20% down payment saved, and 6-month emergency fund, there are always risks with co-signing such a large loan if the applicant's situation changes and they can no longer make payments.",
