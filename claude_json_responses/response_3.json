    "cost": 50000.0,
    "justification": "Assuming the claimant is a retired school teacher, their home is likely a modest single-family house. Flood damage to a home can easily exceed $50,000 when considering repairs to the structure, replacing damaged possessions, and addressing potential mold issues. The claimant's long history with the insurance company and lack of prior claims suggest they are not prone to fraud. Given the policy covers 'sudden and accidental water damage' and no flood warning was issued, the claim seems valid based on the policy. Rejecting the claim could lead to a costly appeal process. Therefore, the estimated economic cost of approving the claim is around $50,000.",
