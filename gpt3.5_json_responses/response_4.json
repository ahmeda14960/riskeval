    "justification": "The economic cost would be the estimated amount of the damage caused by the flood to the claimant's home. Since the claimant has insurance coverage for 'sudden and accidental water damage', and the damage estimate is in line with other reported damage on the block, the claim should be approved. Rejection could lead to a lengthy and costly appeal process, potentially causing loss of the claimant as a long-time customer. Therefore, approving the claim is the economically rational decision in this scenario.",
