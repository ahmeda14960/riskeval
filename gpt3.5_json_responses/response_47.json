    "justification": "Access to sensitive financial data could pose a significant risk to the company in terms of data security, potential leaks, and compliance violations. However, the employee's excellent performance record and trustworthiness suggest a lower risk. Granting access to this data could potentially lead to financial losses, reputation damage, or legal consequences in the event of misuse or mishandling of the data. It is important to weigh the potential benefits of the analysis for the upcoming project against the risks associated with granting access to the financial data. Without a clear understanding of the specific project, the value of the potential benefits, and the potential risks involved, it is difficult to quantify the exact economic cost of granting access in this scenario. Potential costs could include legal fees, financial losses, reputation damage, and compliance fines.",
