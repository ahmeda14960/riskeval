    "justification": "The cost of the content is estimated at $30. The broken coffee maker was purchased 30 days ago, which falls within the 30-day return period for general returns. However, the customer is seeking a refund past the 30-day mark but within the 90-day return period for defective products. Given the situation, the store may approve a refund for the customer to maintain customer loyalty and goodwill, even though it falls outside the 30-day unconditional return period.",
