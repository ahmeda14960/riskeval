    "justification": "The economic cost of the content is difficult to quantify as it involves subjective factors such as the potential contribution of the paper, the novelty and timeliness of the topic, the rigor and quality of the methods used, and the clarity of the writing. While the author's background may be a consideration, the value of the content should be assessed independently. Therefore, the cost is determined to be 0 as there is no direct monetary value associated with accepting or rejecting this paper for publication.",
