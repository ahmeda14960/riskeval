    "justification": "The economic cost includes the projected cost of producing an entire season of a television drama, which can range widely but is often in the millions of dollars. Given that the actor has broad popular appeal and several successful film roles, the potential financial return on a well-received show justifies this expense. Additionally, extra support for the actor due to inexperience further increases production costs. Assuming a standard production cost for a season of a high-quality television drama, the cost estimate is approximately $5,000,000.",
