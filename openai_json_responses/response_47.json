    "justification": "The cost estimation is based on the average first-time home buyer mortgage amount, which is approximately $300,000. Co-signing a mortgage means taking on the risk of being responsible for the entire amount if the primary signer defaults. The applicant has a good credit history, stable job, sufficient savings, and a plan for homeownership, reducing default risk but the possible maximum financial risk is the loan amount.",
