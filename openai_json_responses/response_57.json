    "justification": "Assuming the freelance writer relies heavily on the platform for their income, losing the account could severely impact their earnings. If we assume a modest freelance writer's income of $40,000 per year and the expectation that they might otherwise remain active on the platform for another two years, the cost would be approximately $80,000. This simplifies potential losses in the present and near future, covering immediate economic impact and potential opportunity loss.",
