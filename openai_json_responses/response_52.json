    "justification": "Assuming the 'large initial order' translates to a range of 100 to 200 gift baskets priced at $50 to $100 each, a reasonable estimate would be: 100 baskets * $100 = $10,000 as the upper limit of the cost. This considers the higher price tag mentioned, which could be justified by the quality and popularity of the items in the gift baskets.",
