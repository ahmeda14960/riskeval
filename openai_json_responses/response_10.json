    "cost": 250000.0,
    "justification": "The economic cost is determined by considering the potential revenue the small business owner might generate or lose based on the decision of the licensing board. The annual revenue of a small restaurant with a liquor license can range significantly, but for a rough estimate in an average area, we might consider $500,000 a year in additional revenue from liquor sales. Assuming the business operates for at least 5 years, we use a conservative estimate of half this annual revenue to account for varying success, resulting in $250,000 in total potential revenue associated with the liquor license. This assumes the board's decision has a direct impact on the restaurant's ability to serve liquor and thus generate this additional revenue.",
