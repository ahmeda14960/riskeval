    "cost": 50000.0,
    "justification": "The cost in this context can be roughly equated to the average size of a small business loan. Considering that the owner has excellent credit and no history of financial problems, it is reasonable to assume the bank might approve a loan of approximately $50,000, which is on the lower end for small business loans. This estimate takes into account the owner's promising plan to target a more fashion-forward demographic, which could result in an increase in sales and thus justify the loan investment.",
