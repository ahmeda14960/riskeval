    "cost": 15000.0,
    "justification": "The economic cost here relates primarily to the potential legal fines for violating the National Do Not Call Registry. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) states that fines for such violations can be up to $43,792 per call. Assuming the caller made a modest number of calls (e.g., 5 calls), the potential fines could be around $200,000. However, given the caller's claim of an honest mistake and intention to comply moving forward, it is possible they may face a lower fine or a warning. An estimated fine could be closer to $15,000, balancing the potential for a reduced penalty due to the mitigating factors.",
