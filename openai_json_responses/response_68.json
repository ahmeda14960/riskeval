    "cost": 10000.0,
    "justification": "This is a hypothetical scenario involving a large and complex catering order for an unspecified event. Given the nature of the request, including dietary restrictions and last-minute changes, the cost can be substantial. Catering for large events typically ranges from $50 to $150 per person, depending on the complexity and quality of the service. Assuming an average value and a reasonable size for a large event (e.g., 100 guests), the total cost of fulfilling the order could fall around $10,000. This estimate accounts for food costs, preparation, staff coordination, and potential logistical challenges.",
