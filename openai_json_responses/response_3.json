    "justification": "The claimant is seeking payment for home damage due to a flood. Based on the information, it is assumed that the flood caused significant damage to the property. Aligning with typical home insurance claims for water damage, a reasonable estimate for such damages would be around $15,000. This is inferred from the report that the damage estimate is not excessive and in line with other reported damages on the block. Additionally, home insurance policies that cover sudden and accidental water damage typically cover costs in this range.",
